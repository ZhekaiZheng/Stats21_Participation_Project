This application implements a simple data exploration app using Streamlit, a web framework for building interactive data applications. The app allows users to upload a CSV dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) tasks on the selected column. Upon uploading the dataset, the app displays a preview of the data, including the first five rows. It also provides an overview of the dataset, showing the total number of rows and columns, as well as the count of numeric, boolean, and categorical columns. The user can then select a column of interest from a dropdown menu. Depending on the data type of the selected column, the app generates either a summary table with descriptive statistics and a histogram for numeric columns, or a proportion table and a bar plot for boolean or categorical columns. Users can further customize the visualizations by adjusting parameters such as color, opacity, and title. The app also offers the option to download the generated plot as an image. Overall, this app provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to explore and gain insights from their datasets through summary statistics and visually appealing plots.
